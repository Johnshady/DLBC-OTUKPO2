 <h2 style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px; font-style: italic;">We know that the biggest miracle we will ever see is someone receiving Jesus as their Savior! Plus, it is the only one that has eternal value. We pray that there are people who receive salvation at every meeting we hold. We also pray for signs and miracles that will point people to the One true God that loves them and truly can set the captive free!

We receive several calls a day from people who want us to pray for them but please, please, remember that Jesus is the Healer! We are just people who are in love with God and have no more privileged access to Him than anybody else. Anyone who wants to have relationship with Him can pray and know that He is listening to them because He loves us. The Bible tells us in James 4:7 “Come near to God and He will come near to you.”</h2></div>

    <h3>Three days before Thanksgiving my daughter and I decided to go horseback riding. While warming up the horses in our arena I was thrown by my young horse. I knew it was serious; I couldn’t move and the pain was excruciating. After X-rays and CAT scan they discovered I had separated my pelvis front to back along with internal injuries. A few days in the ICU and some time in recovery and I was back home and on the mend. With the help of physical therapy I was back on my feet in just six weeks. All seemed to be going well but the pain in my hips began to increase. At three months out I could barely walk and the pain was unbearable.  More X-rays and a MRI showed that my pelvis had become “unstable” separating again putting pressure on my hip joints. My orthopedic surgeon’s only idea was a plan that involved metal plates, screws, along with the risk that it might not relieve the pain and it could break as active as I am. None of the options sounded good so, depressed and feeling defeated my wife and I began to pray.

God had a better plan I just didn’t know it yet. My friend James came over to shoe my horse and realized how painful it was for me to just stand keeping the horse calm. He mentioned that his friend Bruce Carlson was in town and that he had prayed for people like me and God healed them. He wondered if I would be interested in visiting him and see what God might do.

I met them at his ranch. I shared with Bruce what had happened and how my pelvis actually shifted and separated as I tried to move,  and how the pain was so bad I was barely able to walk, sit, or stand.  He said have a seat right here in this straight back chair. Bruce took and held the heels of my feet in his hands, the three of us could all see that the right one was an inch or so shorter than the other. (Pelvis out of alignment) Bruce began to pray taking Gods word as true and trusting Christ would do as He promised. As He prayed I saw with my own eyes the right heel go out and pass the other then come back perfectly the same as the left. God is putting your pelvis back in alignment Bruce explained. He asked me to stand as he prayed laying his hands on my hips, again believing on Christ and His word for the power in our healing. This time I could actually feel like someone squeezing the SI joints together. When Bruce had finished praying for me I could tell that something was different. Still in pain I went home-that was Thursday. Friday morning I woke up. Humm—not as much pain and I was able to be on my feet much longer. By Sunday (not kidding) I was throwing horseshoes with my boys pain free, loaded and unloaded 3 moving trucks  and I’ve been on the go ever since. I thank my Lord Jesus Christ and His faithful servant Bruce Carlson for the miracle of healing.</h3>   <h2>Odewale John</h2></div>

                    <h3>I worked for the department of corrections for 30 years as a teacher and had just retired. Right after my retirement, I noticed blood in my urine and was diagnosed with stage 2 bladder cancer with very aggressive cancer cells. I was advised by my doctor that because the cancer was extremely aggressive, they suggested the total removal of my bladder and prostate within two weeks. I was told the surgery would be 8 to 9 hours with a 6 to 8 month recovery period. I had a large tumor on my bladder and it had spread into the muscle tissue and the prostrate had cancer as well.

                        My brother and a close friend of his met me one morning for breakfast and Bruce Van Natta came with them to pray for me. My brother told me about Bruce’s story so I was excited to meet him. After we finished eating Bruce asked if he could lay hands on me and pray. Bruce lifted up his shirt and showed me his scars after sharing his incredible story.
                        I sat there as Bruce anointed me with oil and prayed right there amongst everyone in the restaurant. I didn’t feel anything special happen right there and then, however
                        that evening and into the next day I felt vibration going on in my body especially my lower extremities where the cancer was located, it felt strange. For the next couple of months I began to feel much better. I also changed my diet and started eating better too but I knew something was much different.
                        On January 5th of 2012 I went to the University Wisconsin Hospital in Madison for a second opinion and to be retested by an oncology specialists. That morning I was given a blood and urine test followed up with a consultation with experts specializing in bladder cancer. I was told that they had reviewed all the tests and reports from my doctors in Green Bay. It was their consensus that it was in my best interest to pursue the recommendation of my doctor in Green Bay and immediately have the surgery. I was also told that I could forgo the painful retest based on the previous reports and because of the fact it was a very aggressive cancer, they were anxious to do surgery and chemo. I insisted that they scope my bladder again just to make sure.
                        This is where it gets really interesting, during the test the doctor scoped my bladder then called another doctor in to take a look. After 15 minutes he called in a third doctor who while scoping kept whispering to the others. After the procedure they told me because it was so late in the day, they would call me the next day with the results. The following day I was informed by the specialist that the options we discussed yesterday were still open, but the Dr. went on to say that my bladder looked really good and there was no cancer there now, my urine had no traces of blood or bacteria, and that it was their consensus that I wouldn’t need the surgery based on their new observation that the tumors were gone. They suggested I still consider chemo and radiation as a precautionary measure because of the cancer that was originally there but had now vanished. I said no way, I know what chemo and radiation does to the body!
                        It has been a year and I feel the best I have every felt in my life. With changing my diet and eating healthy, I have lost 50 lbs now. Everyone comments on how good I look and how great my skin looks. My blood pressure is in a normal range, and my cholesterol and sugar are normal as well. During one of my tests they said I had the arteries and blood of a 25 year old. I thank God for that day and the willingness of Bruce to take time out and meet and pray with me, I am forever blessed and grateful. One fact I do know, Jesus heals.
